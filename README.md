A visualization tool for various pathfinding algorithms using React.js

<h2>Pathfinding Algorithms</h2>

<h3>Breadth First Search</h3>
Breadth first search is an unweighted graph search algorithm which can be used to calculate the shortest path to a node, here we implement the BFS using a queue data structure.

<h3>Depth First Search</h3>
Depth first search is an unweighted graph search algorithm which can be used to calculate a path to a node, here we implement the DFS using a stack data structure.

<h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
Dijkstra's is a weighted graph search algorithm which can be used to calculate the shortest path to a node, here we implement Dijkstra's using a priority queue made by a heap.

<h2>Maze Generation Algorithms</h2>
<h3>Randomized verticals</h3>
Randomized verticals is a maze generation algorithm in which we make a maze consisting of several vertical lines, with holes placed in random locations.

<h3>Randomized horizontals</h3>
Randomized horizontals is a maze generation algorithm in which we make a maze consisting of several horizontal lines, with holes placed in random locations.

<h3>Recursive division</h3>
Recursive division is a recursive maze generation algorithm in which we keep splitting the grid into sub sections by drawing vertical and horizontal lines, we randomize the location of these lines and also generate random holes. The holes and lines will never coincide.
